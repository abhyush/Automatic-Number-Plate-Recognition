# License Plate Recognition using OpenCV and Tesseract

This project implements an automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) system using **OpenCV** for image processing and **Tesseract OCR** for optical character recognition. The system detects and extracts a license plate from an input image and reads the text on it.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a Python-based solution that:
1. Detects license plates in vehicle images.
2. Extracts the license plate region.
3. Reads the text on the license plate using **Tesseract OCR**.

This can be used in applications such as vehicle monitoring systems, parking management, and traffic surveillance.

## âœ¨ Features
- **License Plate Detection**: Locates the license plate in the image using contour detection.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhances image quality using grayscale conversion, filtering, and edge detection.
- **Text Recognition**: Reads text from the extracted license plate using **Tesseract OCR**.
- **Error Handling**: Handles scenarios where no license plate is detected.
